Autonomous Motorcycle Project.

The proposal suggests building a self-balancing Inline two-wheel electric bike using a gyroscope for stability. This innovation aims to address the challenges of traditional two-wheelers in maintaining balance, especially in accidents. The gyroscope actively adjusts its motion to stabilize the bike, enhancing safety. The prototype includes a BLDC motor, a servo for steering control, and a system to prevent tipping, making it autonomously balanced using real-time data from an MPU-6050 sensor. This design has the potential to significantly improve the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.
